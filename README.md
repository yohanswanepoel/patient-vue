# devfile-stack-nodejs-vue

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e # or `npm run test:e2e:ci` for headless testing
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```


## Building from Local

```bash
    oc delete bc/your-app-name
    oc delete is/your-app-name
    oc new-build --strategy=docker --binary=true --name=your-app-name
    oc start-build your-app-name --from-dir=. 
    oc new-app --image-stream=your-app-name:latest
    oc expose service/your-app-name
```
Enable TLS if route is not working


## Setting environment variables
* look in /opt/app-root
* Use Dockerfile to set
* update start-nginx.sh script with variables you want to set
* Currently only uses ENV - that needs $ENV in the javascript/html

Testing with Podman afterbuilding container
```bash
podman run -d --name tvrep -e ENV=BLUE -p 8080:8080 localhost/tvrep
```
